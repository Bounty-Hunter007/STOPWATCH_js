# STOPWATCH_js

Here is a draft README.md for a gorgeous stopwatch app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

# Stopwatch in JavaScript

This is a beautiful and functional stopwatch web app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Features

- Display current timer value in mm : ss : milliss format
- Buttons to start, stop and reset
- Stylish glassmorphism design

## Usage

The stopwatch allows users to:

- Press start button to start the timer
- Press stop to pause the timer 
- Press reset to set time back to 0 : 0 : 0

The app works smoothly on all screen sizes. The glassmorphism styling gives it a sleek yet retro look.

## Code Overview

The main files/folders are:

- `stopwatch.html` - Contains HTML markup
- `stopwatch.css` - Contains CSS styling 
- `stopwatch.js/` - Contains JavaScript files

The `stopwatch.html` uses semantic HTML tags and has containers for the stopwatch, buttons and laps list.

`stopwatch.css` uses CSS variables, flexbox and glassmorphism effects for styling. Key styles:

- Root variables for colors 
- Flexbox layout
- Frosted glass effect with backdrop filter
- Box shadows, borders and blur for glass effect

The `stopwatch.js/stopwatch.js` handles all stopwatch functionality like timing, updating DOM etc.

`stopwatch.js/utils.js` contains utility functions.
